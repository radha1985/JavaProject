1. Do you want to pass multiple delimiters as sentence separators to the tool?

YES

2. Can you please detail the various failure criterias that you want to consider and pass an error message back to the user?

A: I'm not a technical person, so I'm not sure of what could go wrong when running this program besides a student misspelling the name of the file or specifying the wrong parameters. What I care for is that, in case of errors, the program prints a user-friendly diagnostic message. Just be sure to document your decisions.
